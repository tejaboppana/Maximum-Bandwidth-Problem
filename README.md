**MAXIMUM BANDWIDTH PROBLEM**

Network optimization has been an important area in the current research in computer science and computer engineering. 

*PROBLEM STATEMENT*
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and weights being the bandwidht between the paths, find the maximum bandwith path between two given vertices. Implement the solution using 3 different algorithms :

- Djikstras Algorithm 
- Djisktras algorithm with heap 
- Kruskal algorithm 

Also write functions to genrate sparse graph and dense graph and test the code with both the types of graphs and compare the running time. 
Sparse graph -> Average vertex degree = 6
Dense graph  -> Vertices are adjacent to atleast 20% of the other vertices
